While previous studies in the areas of vehicle motion planning have made important contributions in various aspects, it
is still critically important to develop mathematically rigorous optimization models and computationally tractable algorithms to (1) consider the dynamic effect of vehicle interactions and also (2) reach the full potential of many system-level performance measures such as throughput, capacity, stability and safety. Along this line, this paper aims to address the following theoretical research questions.

1. How to adapt the current car-following models to model traffic interactions of automated vehicles based on available
connectivity and automated functions, and in particular the dynamic process of tight platoon formation and systemlevel control?

2. How to develop a theoretically rigorous optimization model (e.g., in the form of mixed integer programming models)
which could be solvable using standard optimization software such as CPLEX? Desirable multi-vehicle trajectory optimization models should be able to not only satisfy critical operational constraints such as obstacle avoidance, but
also recognize the inherent nature of car following behavior to optimize platoon-level or system-level performance.

3. How to design on-line trajectory optimization algorithms to improve the performance of coupled AVs in a platoon,
under complex traffic conditions with time-dependent capacity bottlenecks and obstacles of moving trajectories?
